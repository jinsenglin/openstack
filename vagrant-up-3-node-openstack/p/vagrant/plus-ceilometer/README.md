controller node :: install ceilometer + gnocchi (Telemetry Metric service)

https://docs.openstack.org/ceilometer/pike/install/install-base-ubuntu.html

Prerequisites

Before you install and configure the Telemetry service, you must configure a target to send metering data to. The recommended endpoint is Gnocchi.

Usage

```
# display_name -> resource_id
openstack metric resource list --type instance -c id -c display_name

# resource_id -> metric_id
openstack metric resource show RESOURCE_ID

# metric_id -> measures
openstack metric measures show METRIC_ID

# details of a specific metric
openstack metric show METRIC_ID

# About points, granularity, timespan, archive policy
# See https://gnocchi.xyz/operating.html
# * If your archive policy defines a policy of 10 points with a granularity of 1 second, the time series archive will keep up to 10 seconds, each representing an aggregation over 1 second. This means the time series will at maximum retain 10 seconds of data between the more recent point and the oldest point. That does not mean it will be 10 consecutive seconds: there might be a gap if data is fed irregularly.
# * 1440 points with a granularity of 1 minute = 24 hours

# About architecture of ceilometer + gnocchi
# See https://docs.openstack.org/ceilometer/pike/contributor/architecture.html
```

next step :: install aodh (Telemetry Alarming service)

https://docs.openstack.org/aodh/pike/install/install-ubuntu.html

Usage

```
# create alarm (threshold rule alarm)
aodh alarm create --name ALARM-NAME --type gnocchi_resources_threshold --description 'ALARM-NAME' --metric cpu_util --threshold 70.0 --comparison-operator gt --aggregation-method mean --granularity 600 --evaluation-periods 3 --alarm-action 'log://' --resource-id RESOURCE_ID --resource-type instance

# This creates an alarm that will fire when the average CPU utilization for an individual instance exceeds 70% for three consecutive 10 minute periods. The notification in this case is simply a log message, though it could alternatively be a webhook URL.

# details of an specific alarm
openstack alarm show ALARM_ID

# About threshold, comparison-operator, aggregation-method, granularity, evaluation-periods
# See https://docs.openstack.org/aodh/pike/admin/telemetry-alarms.html
# * The alarm granularity must match the granularities of the metric configured in Gnocchi.
# * As of Ocata, the threshold rule alarm is deprecated since Ceilometerâ€™s native storage API is deprecated.
# * Combination rule alarms are deprecated as of Newton for composite alarms. Combination alarm functionality is removed in Pike.
# * -> Composite rule alarms are recommended.
